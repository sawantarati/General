Server hardening is a process of enhance security on your linux host.

Steps to perform server hardning
1 - BIOS protection - configure your server to bios from CD dvd or flopy disk enable password for BIOS for physical servver
2 - Disk Encryption 
3 - Disk Protection - Disk partitions
4 - lock boot directpry FSTAB
5 - Disable USB 
6 - System updates
7 - have only required packages
8 - unwanted service to remove 
9 - Disable unused port
10 - ssh secure communication 
11 restricy root access
12 - lock cron /etc/cron.allow cron.deney ALL
SELINUX - ENABLE
DISABLE IPV6
password policy
restrict old possword
Firewall apply rules in ip tables to allow or dely traffic


SElinux - security enhanced linux is linnux kernal security module whixh support security access control policies

      DAC -discretionary access control (All programs access old)
      MAC - Mandatory access control (Adminstrator)
      SE linux allows MAC type of security policies which allows more refined access policies thand tradition unix file permission
      deney access to other ports
      SE linux is domain type model
      SE linux is process has a context consisting of three part 1 - indentity 2 - role 3 - domain

 PROC
 
 It contains useful information about the processes that are currently running, 
 it is regarded as control and information center for kernel. 
 The proc file system also provides communication medium between kernel space and user space.
 
 
 /proc/cmdline – Kernel command line information.
/proc/console – Information about current consoles including tty.
/proc/devices – Device drivers currently configured for the running kernel.
/proc/dma – Info about current DMA channels.
/proc/fb – Framebuffer devices.
/proc/filesystems – Current filesystems supported by the kernel.
/proc/iomem – Current system memory map for devices.
/proc/ioports – Registered port regions for input output communication with device.
/proc/loadavg – System load average.
/proc/locks – Files currently locked by kernel.
/proc/meminfo – Info about system memory (see above example).
/proc/misc – Miscellaneous drivers registered for miscellaneous major device.
/proc/modules – Currently loaded kernel modules.
/proc/mounts – List of all mounts in use by system.
/proc/partitions – Detailed info about partitions available to the system.
/proc/pci – Information about every PCI device.
/proc/stat – Record or various statistics kept from last reboot.
/proc/swap – Information about swap space.
/proc/uptime – Uptime information (in seconds).
/proc/version – Kernel version, gcc version, and Linux distribution installed.

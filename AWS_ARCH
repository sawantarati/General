IPV4 - 32 Bits
IPV6 - 128 Bits

Network preserved Ip
10.0.0.0 - network address
10.0.0.1 - reserved by aws for vc router
10.0.0.2 -  reserved by aws for ip of dns server
10.0.0.3 - reserved for aws future use
10.0.0.255 - network broadcast addr , boradcast is not supported in VPC , therefore the ip is reserved.

VPC Endpoint - Connect qws services to S3 or other vpc services via private network.

Interface endpoints - other ext service which created within a subnet via private network.

ALB — Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS traffic), Flexible.
NLB — Layer 4 (TLS/TCP/UDP traffic), Static IPs.
CLB — Layer 4/7 (HTTP/TCP/SSL traffic), Legacy, Avoid


Security grops 
Operates at instance levels3 glacier
Supports Allow rules only
Stateful - return traffic is auto allowed
Apply only to a instance while creating if we are slecting or associating later on


Operates at subnet level
supports both alow and deny rule
Stateless - return traffic must be explicitly  allow by rules
Auto allowed to all instances within a subnet.

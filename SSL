------HTTP - http over secure socket layer communication between browser and web-server is enceypted

Builder trust

When browser sends req (Secure pages)--> Web server sends (Digital certificate) signature in form of public auth  which is CA

Browser verify digital signature(trust green pedlock)

Browser created a symmetric key (symetric key) encrypted over public key

Web Server decrypt key using private key

Now communication happens.

Asymmetric algorithm used to verify the identity of owner public key so that trust is built.

Once the Connection is established a symmetric key a shared key is used to encrypt and decrypt all traffic between them.

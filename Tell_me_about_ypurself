Hi This is Arati, i have 5 years of experience in devops and SRE related activities.
I have used github enterprise for version control system.
Jenkins for contineous integration. i have installed jenkins from scratch created master slave configaration. created jenkins pipeline job as per developer requirement.
i have used both nexus artifactory and JFrog for storing artifacts.
For configuration management i have used ansible for creation of services, setting up secrtes and doing mannual deployments on server.
Our application are containerised, so i have working exp on Docker and kubenetes.
I have got chance to set-up whole pipeline thorugh K8s. where i am using helm for doing deployments.
For monitoring purpose we are using slunk and telegraf graphana.
Recently we have started moving application to apple.
